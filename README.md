# EmojiDetect
**Developed by Jung and Chris at UC Irvine**

## Description
**EmojiDetect** is an innovative project that combines advanced computer vision techniques and emoji generation. Here's what it does:

- **Responsive Motion Detection**: EmojiDetect's motion detection capability allows it to identify various hand movements, providing appropriate emoji responses based on the gestures detected, making the interaction more dynamic..

- **Accuracy and Efficiency Improvements**: The model incorporates IoU threshold optimization and non-maximum suppression in Faster R-CNN, enhancing detection precision and reducing response time by 30%..

- **Object Detection with Faster R-CNN**: Powered by PyTorch and Faster R-CNN, EmojiDetect processes webcam footage to detect hand gestures, converting them into corresponding Apple keyboard emojis with an 87.5% mAP.

- **Motion Detection for Diverse Emoji Responses**: A key feature of EmojiDetect is its motion detection capability. This allows the system to detect a variety of gestures, such as waving hands, and respond with suitable emojis. This adds a dynamic and interactive dimension to the emoji generation process.
